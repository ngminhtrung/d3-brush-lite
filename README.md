- `d3-brush-lite` is modified version of `d3-brush`.
- Author of `d3-brush` is Mike Bostock. Here is the link to its homepage: https://github.com/d3/d3-brush
- Author of `d3-brush-lite` is Peter Kerpedjiev (blog EmptyPipes). Peter created this code for his block sample [here](http://emptypipes.org/2017/04/29/d3v4-selectable-zoomable-force-directed-graph/).
- Peter Kerpedjiev created `d3-brush-lite` because the original `d3-brush` in D3 v4 captures the shift, alt and meta keys to perform some actions by default. To get around this, he forked d3-brush and modified it so that it doesn't capture the shift events. The new version (d3-brush-lite) can be found on [github](https://github.com/pkerpedjiev/d3-brush-lite).
- This repo is almost 100% forked from Peter's repo. It is published to npmjs solely for convenient installation into personal nodejs-based project.
